                    the sole discretion of Sponsor, result in a winner's disqualification and the selection of an
                    alternate winner. Return of any prize/prize notification as undeliverable will result in
                    disqualification and an alternate winner will be selected. All decisions of Sponsor are final and
                    binding.
